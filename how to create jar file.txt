1. Install Java Extension Pack on VS code if dont have it yet:
Open VS Code and go to the Extensions view by clicking on the Extensions icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or by pressing Ctrl+Shift+X.
Search for "Java Extension Pack" and install it.

2. Organize the Project to:
project-root/
├── src/
│   ├── javafiles/
│   ├── images/
│   └── sounds/
└── .vscode/

3. Configure settings.json
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Preferences: Open Settings (JSON).
Add the following configuration to include your resource directories:
{
  "java.project.sourcePaths": ["src/javafiles"],
  "java.project.outputPath": "bin",
  "java.project.referencedLibraries": ["src/images", "src/sounds"]
}

//I used src/images and src/sounds instead of putting them in rss folder cuz i had too little to to debug since moving the rss to rss folder creates an error in which the compiler cant find the files

4. Build the .jar File:
Open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type Java: Export Jar.
Select your main class when prompted. This class should contain the main method.
VS Code will package your .jar file, including the resources from src/images and src/sounds.

5. After that there will be a prompt on the bottom right of your screen to reveal the file location or u can use the file explorer it should be at main_dir of your project folder, same level as src
